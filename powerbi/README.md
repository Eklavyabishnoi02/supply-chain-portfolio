# Power BI

`.pbix` files for dashboards (screenshots live in `reports/`).

## Files (planned)
- `packaging_savings.pbix` — visualizes KPIs: savings, jam reduction, throughput, site ramp readiness.

## Best practice
- Save a PNG of key report pages to `reports/imgs/` and embed them in the root `README.md`.
- Avoid committing autosave files (`*.pbix.tmp`); they’re ignored by `.gitignore`.
